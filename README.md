# Car Price Prediction with Linear Regression

This project aims to predict car prices using a dataset containing various features of cars such as make, model, year, engine specifications, and more. We employ Linear Regression, a fundamental machine learning algorithm, to build a predictive model that estimates the price of a car based on its attributes.

**Project Overview**
**Objective**
The primary goal of this project is to develop a reliable model that can predict the price of a car using its features. This involves:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Feature engineering and handling missing values.
- Training and evaluating a Linear Regression model.

**Tools and Libraries**
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib/Seaborn 
- Scikit-learn used for Linear Regression and model evaluation.

**How to Use This Project?**

- Open the Notebook:
    - Go to Google Colab
    - Click on "File" > "Open notebook"
    - Upload the Regression_Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb file
    - Upload the Dataset: Upload the data.csv file to Google Colab (click the folder icon on the left sidebar and upload)

-  In the notebook, update the file path to point to your data.csv:
     df = pd.read_csv('/content/data.csv')  # Update this path if needed

  
- Run the Notebook: Execute each cell sequentially by clicking the play button or using Shift+Enter
